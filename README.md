I re-implemented it in Kotlin because:
1. This forces me to actually learn the material now that I'm translating it
2. I haven't used Kotlin in three years and its fun to revisit

Running the code requires [Kotlin Notebooks](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16340-kotlin-notebook) which are based of Jupyter Notebooks. I'm not sure how to import other classes into Kotlin Notebooks just yet, but once I learn I'll break out Value and the neural nets into other files / folders.
